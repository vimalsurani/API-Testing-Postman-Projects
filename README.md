## Project Name: Number Conversion Service

## Project URL
[Number Conversion Service API Documentation](https://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver/NumberConversion.wso?op=NumberToWords)

## Project Description
This project involves testing the SOAP API for number to words conversion. The API converts numerical input into its English word equivalent. The testing focuses on validating the functionality of the API endpoint and handling various input scenarios.

## Test Cases
A set of Postman test cases have been created to cover different scenarios for the number to words conversion API. These include positive and negative test cases to ensure robustness and accuracy in conversion results.

## Running Tests with Newman
Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to run and test a Postman collection directly from the command line.
